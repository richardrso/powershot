# Minimalist Photography Journal

## Overview

This project is a **minimalist photography site,** part blog, part photo journal, created to showcase personal photographs alongside short texts that tell the story, context, or emotion behind each shot.

The goal is to create an experience similar to a very stripped-down Instagram or photo blog, but without feeds, algorithms, or distractions. Just images, words, and space.

## Philosophy

This site is intentionally built with:

* **Only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
* **No frameworks**
* **No build tools**
* **No libraries**

Everything is written **by hand**, with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and performance.

The idea is to let the content speak for itself:

* The photographs are the focus
* The text adds meaning, not noise
* The design stays quiet and unobtrusive

---

## Why No Frameworks?

This project avoids frameworks and tools on purpose:

* To keep the site **lightweight and fast**
* To have full control over every line of code
* To avoid unnecessary abstractions
* To embrace the simplicity of the web’s core technologies

By using only native web technologies, the site remains easy to understand, easy to maintain, and free from external dependencies.
